# Decorator

The decorator pattern is used to extend or alter the functionality of objects at run-time by wrapping them in an object of a decorator class. This provides a flexible alternative to using inheritance to modify behaviour.

#### Motivation

* Want to augment an object with additional functionality
* Do not want to rewrite or alter existing code
* Want to keep new functionality separate
* Need to be able to interact with existing structures
* Two options
  * Inherit from required object (if possible)
  * Build a Decorator, which simply references the decorated object(s)
