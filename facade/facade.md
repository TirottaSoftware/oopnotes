# Facade

The facade pattern is used to define a simplified interface to a more complex subsystem.

[--> Reference <--](http://www.blackwasp.co.uk/Facade.aspx)

#### Motivation

* Balancing complexity and presentation/usability
* Typical home, same as software!
  * Many subsystems (electrical, sanitation)
  * Complex internal structure (e.g., floor layers)
  * End user is not exposed to internals
