# Prototype

The prototype pattern is used to instantiate a new object by copying all of the properties of an existing object, creating an independent clone. This practise is particularly useful when the construction of a new object is inefficient.

In general, when an object is cloned, the new object is either a shallow or deep copy. A shallow copy duplicates all of the object's properties. If any property contains a reference type, the reference is copied. This means that changes to the referenced object are visible in both the clone and the original object. A deep copy clones the main object and all child objects. Any properties of reference types are also cloned, giving a truly independent copy. The prototype pattern usually generates deep copies, though this is dependant upon the situation.

#### Motivation

* Complicated objects aren't designed from scratch
* Existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a Prototype
* We make a copy of the prototype and customize it (deep copy)
* We make the cloning convenient (e.g., via a _Factory_)
