# Singleton

The singleton pattern ensures that only one object of a particular class is ever created. All further references to objects of the singleton class refer to the same underlying instance.

#### Motivation

For some components it only makes sense to have one in the system
* Database repository
* Object factory

Constructor calls may be expensive
* We want initialization to only happen once
* We provide everyone with the same instance

Want to prevent anyone creating additional coppies
